# European Soccer Game Analysis using SQL

## Overview and Problem Statement
This MySQL Notebook as a demonstration of SQL techniques, including CASE WHEN statements, subqueries, WITH statements, and window functions. The primary goal is to reinforce my own understanding of these techniques while providing a resource that may assist others in learning SQL. In this notebook, we apply these SQL techniques to explore the European Soccer Database.

## The European Soccer Database
The European Soccer Database is a comprehensive repository of data pertaining to top-division football leagues across Europe. It encompasses valuable information about teams, match results, and players, spanning multiple seasons from 2008/09 to 2015/16.

### Data Overview
- **Teams**: Data about football teams competing in various European leagues.
- **Match Results**: Information on match outcomes, including scores, dates, and more.
- **Players**: Details on football players, their attributes, and performance statistics.
- **Seasons**: Records for each football season within the specified time frame.

## Key SQL Techniques Explored
1. **CASE WHEN Statements**: Used to create conditional expressions for data transformation and analysis.
2. **Subqueries**: Employed to retrieve data from nested queries, often as a part of a larger query.
3. **WITH Statements (Common Table Expressions, CTEs)**: Used to simplify complex queries and make them more readable.
4. **Window Functions**: Applied to perform calculations across sets of rows within result sets.

## Usage
To follow along and explore the European Soccer Database using SQL, you can run the provided SQL queries and analyze the results. This notebook serves as both a tutorial and a reference for leveraging these SQL techniques.

## Data Source
